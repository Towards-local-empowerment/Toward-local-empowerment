            From the majestic snow-capped peak of Mount Kenya to the vast savannas of the Maasai Mara,
            teeming with wildlife, the natural beauty is awe-inspiring. 
            Coastal regions like Mombasa offer stunning beaches and vibrant coral reefs, 
            while cities such as Nairobi blend modernity with rich traditions. 
            The diverse ethnic groups, each with their unique customs and languages, 
            add to the rich cultural mosaic of the nation. Kenya is not just a country, 
            but a symphony of sights, sounds, and experiences waiting to be explored.</p>

        <p class="geo" id="geo" >Kenya, officially the Republic of Kenya (Swahili: Jamhuri ya Kenya), is a country in East Africa. 
            With a population of more than 47.6 million in the 2019 census,
            [12] Kenya is the 28th-most-populous country in the world[7] and 7th most populous in Africa. 
            Kenya's capital and largest city is Nairobi, while its oldest and second-largest city, 
            is the major port city of Mombasa, situated on Mombasa Island in the Indian Ocean and the surrounding mainland. 
            Mombasa was the capital of the British East Africa Protectorate, 
            which included most of what is now Kenya and southwestern Somalia, 
            from 1889 to 1907. Other important cities include Kisumu and Nakuru. 
            Kenya is bordered by South Sudan to the northwest, Ethiopia to the north, 
            Somalia to the east, Uganda to the west, Tanzania to the south, and the Indian Ocean to the southeast.</p>
